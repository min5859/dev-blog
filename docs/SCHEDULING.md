# Scheduling

Dev Blog can run the Linux newsletter pipeline as one daily command.

## Daily pipeline command

```bash
npm run daily:linux
```

This runs, in order:

1. `npm run collect:linux`
2. `npm run draft:linux`
3. `npm run research:linux` (configured AI adapter, tool-capable mode)
4. `npm run rewrite:linux` (same adapter, closed rewrite mode)
5. `npm run build`

Research and rewrite use the adapter selected by `defaultAdapter` in
`config/ai-provider.json`. The adapter layer owns provider-specific commands,
models, permissions, and timeouts; the daily pipeline and scheduler are shared.
Supported values are `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, and `template`.

For a one-off full daily run, override the configured value with
`DAILY_REWRITE_ADAPTER=claude|codex|cursor|template`. Research and rewrite
receive the same selected adapter. For one research/rewrite command, use
`AI_ADAPTER=claude|codex|cursor|template`.

By default this command does **not** publish generated drafts into `content/`. Generated artifacts remain under `data/generated/linux/` for review.

Publish explicitly after review:

```bash
npm run publish:linux
```

Or run and publish in one step only when trusted:

```bash
npm run daily:linux:publish
```

The command stops at the first failing step and exits non-zero.

## Logs

Runtime logs are written under `logs/daily/` and ignored by git:

- `logs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-linux.log`
- `logs/daily/linux-latest.log`
- `logs/daily/linux-latest-status.json`

The status JSON is intended for monitoring or notification hooks.

## macOS — use launchd, not cron

On macOS, use one user LaunchAgent for every AI provider. It runs in the same
login session as the selected CLI's authentication cache. Before enabling
publication, verify the configured provider manually from the project directory.
The LaunchAgent only needs a `PATH` containing the selected CLI:

```bash
npm run rewrite:linux
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="<plist PATH>" npm run rewrite:linux
```

A ready-to-use template lives at
`docs/launchd/com.user.dev-blog.daily.plist.template`. Paths inside
it match the developer's machine; copy and edit before installing.

```bash
# 1. Copy the template into your LaunchAgents directory
cp docs/launchd/com.user.dev-blog.daily.plist.template \
   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dev-blog.daily.plist

# 2. Edit paths in the copied plist if your layout differs
#    (npm path, project path, AI CLI directories, log path).

# 3. Load it. The job will fire daily at the StartCalendarInterval time.
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dev-blog.daily.plist

# 4. (Optional) Trigger immediately to verify
launchctl start com.user.dev-blog.daily
tail -f logs/daily/launchd.log
```

To unload (e.g., before editing):

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dev-blog.daily.plist
```

If you previously had a `cron` line for this project, remove it
(`crontab -e`) — running both will publish twice.

### Why the template publishes by default

The template runs `npm run daily:linux:publish`, so the day's
briefing is written into `content/` automatically. The earlier
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` flow assumes this so the post can then be
committed and pushed to GitHub.

### Falling back to the template adapter

Set `DAILY_REWRITE_ADAPTER=template` in `EnvironmentVariables` of the
plist if the configured AI CLI authentication ever breaks. The pipeline will produce a
deterministic, AI-free briefing for the day instead of failing.

## Linux cron (no Keychain involved)

If running on Linux (or any environment without macOS Keychain), cron
works directly. Example:

```cron
PATH=/home/wooki/.local/bin:/home/wooki/.nvm/versions/node/v24.18.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
0 7 * * * cd /home/wooki/project/git/wk/dev-blog && /home/wooki/.nvm/versions/node/v24.18.0/bin/npm run daily:linux:publish >> logs/daily/cron.log 2>&1
```

`PATH` must include the directory holding the CLI selected in
`config/ai-provider.json`. Authenticate that same user before enabling the job.
Runtime data (`data/raw/`, `data/normalized/`, `data/generated/`,
`logs/daily/`) is reproducible and gitignored.

## 오픈소스 큐레이션 (`opensource-curation`)

In-repo pipeline (별도 프로젝트 체크아웃 불필요):

1. `npm run opensource-curation:discover` — GitHub Search + Trending → `data/opensource-curation/repos.json`
2. `npm run opensource-curation:fetch` — README + metadata
3. `npm run opensource-curation:analyze` — `data/opensource-curation/analysis/*.md` (`AI_ADAPTER` / `OPENSOURCE_CURATION_ANALYZE_ADAPTER`, `prompts/opensource-curation-analyze-ko.md`)

Then `npm run daily:opensource-curation` runs those three steps, then collect → draft → rewrite → build. Only blog steps:
`OPENSOURCE_CURATION_SKIP_UPSTREAM=1 npm run daily:opensource-curation`.

Configuration: `content/topics/opensource-curation/opensource-curation.config.json`. Optional: `OPENSOURCE_CURATION_ROOT` for `collect:opensource-curation` if data lives outside the default tree.

## OpenClaw cron option

A future OpenClaw cron job can run an isolated agent turn that executes:

```bash
cd /Users/wooki/project/git/wk/dev-blog && npm run daily:linux
```

Recommended behavior for that job:

- run once per day after expected upstream source updates
- report success/failure summary back to the coding topic
- include `logs/daily/linux-latest-status.json` if failure analysis is needed

Actual OpenClaw cron registration is intentionally not committed into this repository. Register it from the OpenClaw runtime when you want the daily job to become active.

## Manual recovery

If a run fails:

1. Inspect `logs/daily/linux-latest.log`.
2. Fix the failing collector, draft, rewrite, or build step.
3. Re-run `npm run daily:linux`.
4. If the generated draft is acceptable, run `npm run publish:linux`.
5. Run `npm run build`.
6. Commit generated content only if the resulting post should be versioned.
